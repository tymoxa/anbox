/**
 * This file can be used to adjust the badness heuristic used to select which
 * process gets killed in out-of-memory conditions.
 *
 * The badness heuristic assigns a value to each candidate task ranging from 0
 * (never kill) to 1000 (always kill) to determine which process is targeted.
 * The units are roughly a proportion along that range of allowed memory the
 * process may allocate from, based on an estimation of its current memory and
 * swap use. For example, if a task is using all allowed memory, its badness
 * score will be 1000. If it is using half of its allowed memory, its score
 * will be 500.
 *
 * There is an additional factor included in the badness score: root processes are
 * given 3% extra memory over other tasks.
 *
 * The amount of "allowed" memory depends on the context in which the
 * OOM-killer was called. If it is due to the memory assigned to the allocating
 * task's cpuset being exhausted, the allowed memory represents the set of mems
 * assigned to that cpuset (see cpuset(7)). If it is due to a mempolicy's node(s)
 * being exhausted, the allowed memory represents the set of mempolicy nodes. If
 * it is due to a memory limit (or swap limit) being reached, the allowed memory
 * is that configured limit. Finally, if it is due to the entire system being out
 * of memory, the allowed memory represents all allocatable resources.
 *
 * The value of oom_score_adj is added to the badness score before it is used
 * to determine which task to kill. Acceptable values range from -1000
 * (OOM_SCORE_ADJ_MIN) to +1000 (OOM_SCORE_ADJ_MAX). This allows user space to
 * control the preference for OOM-killing, ranging from always preferring a
 * certain task or completely disabling it from OOM- killing. The lowest possible
 * value, -1000, is equivalent to disabling OOM-killing entirely for that task,
 * since it will always report a badness score of 0.
 *
 * Consequently, it is very simple for user space to define the amount of
 * memory to consider for each task. Setting a oom_score_adj value of +500, for
 * example, is roughly equivalent to allowing the remainder of tasks sharing
 * the same system, cpuset, mempolicy, or memory controller resources to use at
 * least 50% more memory. A value of -500, on the other hand, would be roughly
 * equivalent to discounting 50% of the task's allowed memory from being
 * considered as scoring against the task.
 *
 * For backward compatibility with previous kernels, /proc/[pid]/oom_adj can
 * still be used to tune the badness score. Its value is scaled linearly with
 * oom_score_adj.
 *
 * Writing to /proc/[pid]/oom_score_adj or /proc/[pid]/oom_adj will change the
 * other with its scaled value.
