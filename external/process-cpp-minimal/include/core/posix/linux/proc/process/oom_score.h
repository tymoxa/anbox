 * increases (+) or decreases (-) for factors including:
 *
 *   - whether the process creates a lot of children using fork(2) (+);
 *   - whether the process has been running a long time, or has used a lot of CPU time (-);
 *   - whether the process has a low nice value (i.e., > 0) (+);
 *   - whether the process is privileged (-); and
 *   - whether the process is making direct hardware access (-).
 *
 * The oom_score also reflects the adjustment specified by the oom_score_adj or
